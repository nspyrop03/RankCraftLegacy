⚠️ This project is no longer maintained.

RankCraft was a childhood dream of mine that I managed to bring to life. Most of the code was written when I was between the ages of 12 and 16, so let's just say it's "bad code :D." At the time, many people loved my project, but since I can no longer maintain it, I’ve decided to open-source it and allow others to make changes and further develop it.
For this reason, I’ve made public a "recent" attempt to rewrite RankCraft from scratch. However, there’s still a long way to go before it reaches the level of its legacy version. Feel free to check it out and contribute!
