# ***** Rank System ***** #
# Here you can write your own Ranks!
# Ranks Syntax:
# - '<rank_name>:<level_required>'
# NOTE: Be sure not to have 2 or more ranks with the same level because there will be an error
# Tip: You can use color codes with the '&' symbol!
# When the player joins for the first time he will take the first Rank
# So make the first Level something like this: 'None:0'

Ranks:
- 'None:0'
- '&eBegginer:5'
- '&3Citizen &6I:10'
- '&3Citizen &cII:20'
- '&3Citizen &4III:35'
- '&6Master:50'
